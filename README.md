## ⚡ About

Yes, this is a really long profile. TL;DR: I build production-ready Java back-end systems that are reliable, observable, and easy to operate.

I'm a Java back-end engineer (with experience from legacy Java 6+ to modern Java 17/21) who builds with an owner's mindset. I move comfortably between critical production environments and continuous evolution: stabilizing systems, mitigating risk, improving performance, and modernizing safely without disrupting operations.

While my primary focus is back-end, I work with a full-cycle mindset and hands-on experience in cloud, containers, and DevOps. I’ve also shipped front-end when needed to deliver end-to-end solutions. I have a strong foundation in logical and computational thinking, problem structuring, domain modeling, and impact-driven technical decision-making (cost, risk, performance, and maintainability).

My style is pragmatic execution with high standards. I enjoy complex problems and end-to-end ownership, with emphasis on architecture, reliability, security, and real observability (structured logs, metrics, and tracing). I believe good software is software that survives production and is easy to operate. I prioritize simplicity, consistent delivery, and continuous improvement—through profiling, SQL optimization, incremental refactoring, patterns, and automation to evolve systems predictably.

At FIAP, I earned recognitions that reflect execution and competitiveness: N2020, NEXT, Global Solution (UN), and the NEXT Medal. I also have experience in people development (mentoring, feedback, alignment, and work organization) and value an inclusive and accessible environment, with practical attention to day-to-day work and support for people with disabilities.

Outside the corporate world, I have an entrepreneurial background: projects that worked and others that didn’t scale—experiences that trained me in rapid validation, focus, cost/benefit thinking, and execution. I also created gaming content (Pikachu Gamer), which strengthened communication, consistency, presence, and community-building—skills I bring into leadership and product.

Core technologies/topics I apply most: Java 6–21+ • Spring Boot/Security (JWT/OAuth2) • REST APIs (OpenAPI/Swagger) • JPA/Hibernate/JdbcTemplate • PostgreSQL + Flyway • Testing (JUnit/Mockito) • Docker/CI/CD • Cloud/containers • Observability (Actuator/Micrometer/structured logs/metrics/tracing) • Kubernetes/OpenShift • DevOps practices and production operations • Front-end fundamentals for full-cycle delivery.

PT-BR: Native • EN: Studying • ES: Studying
